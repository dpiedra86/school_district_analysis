4th Bootcamp Challenge

#Overv#iew 

The purpose of this project was to understand how Jupyter Notebook works. 
Jupyter is a flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning, as described in their website. Jupyter combined with Python and it's vast pool of libraries allow the user to perform deep analysis by manipulating data from a any given source without actually editing the input data from the original source. 

The request was to create a deep analysis to understand how well the schools taking a districtal test perfromed. For this test we had a couple of data sets and the tool we were asked to use was Python and mainly Pandas libraries. With this, we had the right tools to manipulate the data in both datasets to merge, group, add, substract and compare along other operations we dide to understand with tbales and summaries the results obtained. 

## Results

### How is the district summary affected?

District Summary All Schools

District Summary excluding THS 9th graders

> **Conclusion**: 
Only the passing percentages were affected, and it happened ina minor scale. THS does not represent a large amount of data so it is only perceptible by using decimal figures.

### How is the school summary affected?

School Summary excluding THS 9th graders

> **Conclusion**: At a school level the percentages are greatly affected. This means 9th grade was raising the numbers with high math and reading grades. 
> We could deep dive into this data to get more information if needed. 

### How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

Thomas High School excluding THS 9th graders

> **Conclusion**: Without the 9th graders THS fails to pass the minimum of 70% overall.


## How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
### Math and reading scores by grade
> **Conclusion**: 


### Scores by school spending
> **Conclusion**: 


### Scores by school size
> **Conclusion**: 


### Scores by school type
> **Conclusion**:
