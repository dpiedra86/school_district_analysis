#Overv#iew 

The purpose of this project was to understand how Jupyter Notebook works. 
Jupyter is a flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning, as described in their website. Jupyter combined with Python and it's vast pool of libraries allow the user to perform deep analysis by manipulating data from a any given source without actually editing the input data from the original source. 

The request was to create a deep analysis to understand how well the schools taking a districtal test perfromed. For this test we had a couple of data sets and the tool we were asked to use was Python and mainly Pandas libraries. With this, we had the right tools to manipulate the data in both datasets to merge, group, add, substract and compare along other operations we dide to understand with tbales and summaries the results obtained.
